## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

An API is basically a set of rules that allows different software programs to interact with eachother. The website(user) makes a request and the api functions as the middle man sending that request to the system or service youre requesting
that is programmed and stored on a server waiting to be called upon to then complete the task and send it back to the user. 

A simple example would be: 
You (the website) place an order through a online shopping app(the API) to order a coffee machine.
The online shopping app(the API) then sends a request to the supplier(the servers where the program is held) that you want a coffee machine and the supplier(the program) 
sends one to you.

API are essential to developers because it allows them to implement deeper functionality within their programs without having to create everything themselves by having access to third party services
such as online payment, access to social media and mapping services like google maps where the program already exists and they just have to implement it within their website.

I used an API when I made a weather website by using a pre-existing weather api and chose the data I wanted displayed on the website. This meant I did not have to create code to source the information 
one by one.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

[Your answer goes here]

In simple terms both interface and API's facilitate interactions between things however an interface defines how all things interact with other things within programming on a broader spectrum
whereas APIs are more specified with that it is a set of rules on how different software systems interact with each other. 

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

[Your answer goes here]

The main components of APIs are endpoints, methods and formats. Endpoints are specific urls and uris which define how and where users access the functionality of the APIs, endpoints represent the path a user takes to access 
a certain function and are unique. Methods are actions the user can perform on the API which include GET(retrieve data), POST(create new resource), PUT(update existing resource) and DELETE(delete resource).
Data formats is the structure and syntax of the data in order to communicate with computer systems some examples are JSON (Javascript Object Notion) which is easy for both humans and machines to use as well as its 
compatibility with javascript and many other languages it has become the standard in the industry.

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

[Your answer goes here]

I went through the Spotify for developers web api library and interacted with it exploring the vast information you can access and thinking of ways I'd implement the different things into a web app of my own.
I also started playing with curl in my terminal how ever I found it slightly daunting at first when all this different data just appears in your terminal but slowly while working through the API course I was able to find some 
sort of way of navigating through everything. I'm very interested in learning much more about APIs and researching different APIs i can use and access and see what inspires me to take further and also looking 
at what apis I could implement into pre-existing prjects I've already made in order to make it better. 


5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

[Your answer goes here]

I know that my my knowledge is very rudementary and I won't be able to say that I am confident in any given area without loads more practice especially within figuring out what would go where and how to implement apis 
into possible projects that I would like to work on however I think the best way for me to progress is just basic trial and error. I do however feel as though I have a good understanding of the bases of APIs and I look
forward to building on it because at the moment I can already start thinking of cool things I can do and I am only held back by my technical knowledge on APIs.
